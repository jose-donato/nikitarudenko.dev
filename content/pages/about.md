bio: I am a **frontend developer** with some skills in a Node.js-driven backend world.
  I always loved bringing a great experience to users. Fortunately, one day it became
  my profession. My best friends in this occupation are **React** and **Next.js.**

learning: Currently, I'm excited about the **JAMstack** world. I experiment with combining **Next.js** with different API sources, and building lightweight full-stack apps.

Is there any web developer who has never used Cascading Style Sheets? Of course not, it‚Äôs one of the core technologies in the modern web. But here is a thing, despite its simplicity, CSS can be tedious to work with. Backend developers who once decided to fix something in styles on the frontend can‚Äôt be wrong üòõ

The problem is that we don‚Äôt take CSS seriously. Once most of us got acknowledged with it and ran through all of its important topics, we never revisit it again. Then we tend to avoid it while working with ‚Äúreal‚Äù programming languages and rely on a bunch of classes of the chosen CSS framework. As a result, our knowledge about CSS becomes a mess consisted of bits of information and at this point, some of us start to hate dealing with it.

In this blog post, I‚Äôd like to give an overview of the most important topics about CSS with helpful resources that can hopefully fill in your blank spaces.

\#### 1. Layout and positioning

Knowing this topic will save you a lot of mental health. Ever wondered why the heck after applying \`position: absolute\` your element jumped away? Or why after using animation with\`transform\` your layout messes up? There much more things that will become clear to you after mastering this.

bio: I am a **frontend developer** with some skills in a Node.js-driven backend world.
  I always loved bringing a great experience to users, this is what helps your creation
  to stand out. Fortunately, one day it became my profession. My best friends in this
  occupation are **React** and **Next.js.**
